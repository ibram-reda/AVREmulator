# AVREmulator
This is an AVR Emulator written for Fun, this emulator currently build For Atmega32, in future I hope to make it general to work with all AVR family.

## Resources
The resources of information that i follow to build this emulator is
1. book : `The AVR Microcontroller and Embedded Systems Using Assembly and C` By Muhammad Ali Mazidi
2. [AVR opcode summary][1]
3. [AVR instruction set manual][2]

## install
For now there is no UI interface for the project (it will be added soon) but you can download the source code and run the tests and play around with it ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‰

to be able to run the code, you need the Visual Studio 22 or .net 6 SDK to be installed in your machine 
1. Download the project : you can download it as ZIP file or through git as following
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ibram-reda/AVREmulator.git
```
2. inside the project folder you can found `AVREmulator.sln` file open it with vs22
3. to see see tests result within VS22 right click on prject name `AvREmulatorTests` and select Run Tests Then open test explorer window to see the result

if you don't have vs22 you can run the test from termnal or cmd by run the following command
```cmd
dotnet test
```

## How to use
We should instantiate an object of type `AVRController` and give it your AVR code program as hex file to execute it when power up the controller (which emulate connect a VCC), for now power up method will stop after `1000` cycle (hard coded value) that mechanism will change in future 
```c#
AVRController Controller = new(@".\path\to\yourprogram.hex");
Controller.PowerUp();
```
**Note that**: the emulator is still not support all kind of AVR instructions so it will probably fail to execute the hex file. you can see all [supported instruction in our emulator][3]

the following is a simple code example can run and test with our emulator
```asm
Start:
    LDi r18,0x29  ;Load Register 18 with value 0x29 
    rjmp Start    ;Repete that again 
```
the hex file for the above program can be found [Here][4]
